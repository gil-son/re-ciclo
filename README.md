<p>
Re-ciclo emerged in 2020 as an academic project of the institution Recode Pro and conceived by Squad 07. Our objective is to bring a solution in favor of Sustainable Development, aiming at one of the UN objectives: Responsible Consumption and Production.
</p>

### Our mission

<p>
We created an application that will connect people living in affordable housing to collection points. In addition to taking information about recycling, people will have access to personalized pages to carry out a good management of recyclables. Through partners, all the infrastructure necessary for the implementation of the project will be made available (storage, collection, control of quantity/weight, management of materials and values).
</p>

### Our values

<p>
Re-ciclo understands the importance of the environmental balance that our planet needs and is committed to taking this responsibility to people who are unable to adhere to waste recycling in their daily lives. Through information, structure and awareness, we believe that recycling can improve the quality of life for low-income people.
</p>

### Our vision

<p>
The project aims to revert the values ​​that are generated through the sale of recyclable waste to be used for the benefit of all residents. Each material will be evaluated, its values ​​will be accumulated and managed by the partner and reverted in the form of maintenance for the condominium (painting, plumbing, renovation of the leisure area, gardening).
